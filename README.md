In the quiet of the twilight hour, Where whispers dance and dreams empower, A single star begins to shine, Guiding hearts with its light divine.

Waves of time and echoes past, Moments fleeting, yet memories last. Through laughter sweet and tears weâ€™ve shed, Life's tapestry in colors spread.

Embrace the dawn with open eyes, Beneath the vast and endless skies. For every day a chapter new, In this grand tale that we pursue.
